# sdrsharp-bladerf

bladeRF driver for SDR#


## Installation

### Windows

#### Precompiled binaries

1. Download the [official precompiled SDR# plugin binaries](https://nuand.com/downloads/bladeRF_SDRsharp.zip)
2. Unzip to SDR# directory
3. Launch SDR#

#### Compiling from source

1. Copy the Release\SDRSharp.BladeRF.dll into SDR# installation directory
2. If required, copy all DLL files from LibBladeRF subdirectory to SDR# installation directory
3. Add the following line in the frontendPlugins sections of FrontEnds.xml file:

	&lt;add key="BladeRF" value="SDRSharp.BladeRF.BladeRFIO,SDRSharp.BladeRF" /&gt;


4. Launch SDR# and cross fingers :)

**Be aware that any update of SDR# will require you to follow again steps 2 to 4!**

### Linux

To use SDR# on Linux, you need to first install a version of Mono that supports .Net framework 4.6.

At the moment, the setup has been tested using Mono 4.4.0.40 and is working.


1. Copy the Release/SDRSharp.BladeRF.dll into SDR# installation directory
2. Symlink required libraries in the SDR# installation directory:

	```bash
	$ ln -s /usr/lib/libportaudio.so.2 libportaudio.so
	$ ln -s /usr/local/lib/libbladeRF.so .
	```

3. Add the following line in the frontendPlugins sections of FrontEnds.xml file:

	&lt;add key="BladeRF" value="SDRSharp.BladeRF.BladeRFIO,SDRSharp.BladeRF" /&gt;


4. Launch SDR# and cross fingers :)

## Troubleshooting

If your samples look "weird" under SDR#, be sure to use a compatible libusb-1.0.dll.
Specially when frequently upgrading SDR#, it will re-install the RTL-SDR driver which embedds a pretty old version of this DLL (v.1.0.14).
The version provided under LibBladeRF directory of this repository (currently v1.0.19) is known to work correcly with both RTL-SDR dongles and BladeRF. So it is safe (and recommended) to replace it.

If this does not solve your issue, feel free to report a bug here. I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
Same goes for new features.


## Compilation

If you need/want to compile this DLL, you need to copy the following two DLL files
from SDR# installation directory to Release and/or Debug directories:

1. SDRSharp.Radio.dll
2. SDRSharp.Common.dll

Compiling under Linux is also possible using Mono 4.4.0.40+ (even if a warning is issued to tell that building with framework 4.6 is
not supported.

Be aware that Mono xbuild uses different pathes for compilation so you will need to copy the 2 aforementioned DLL files in the
building directory expected by Mono xbuild for the compilation to succeed.
